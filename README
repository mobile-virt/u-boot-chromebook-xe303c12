This is the u-boot code forked from : 

https://github.com/virtualopensystems/u-boot/

and updated to today,with the goal to virtualize FreeBSD or Linux on the ARM Chromebook model xe303c12 with use qemu and kvm on a more recent kernel version
(5.4.257) on top of an upgraded Linux distro (Devuan 5). It works at today even if some slightly changes are needed to the source code.
